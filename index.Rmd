    <p>Hello! I'm a postdoctoral researcher working on mathematical modelling of infectious diseases. I'm            currently based at Institut Pasteur (EMEA unit) and at the Conservatoire National des Arts et MÃ©tiers (MESuRS lab). My focus is on antimicrobial resistance (AMR), particularly how this problem evolves, spreads, and can be prevented. For this, I study AMR across scales, from the invisible dynamics of gene transfer in bacterial populations, up the spread of pathogens across complex human contact networks.</p>
    <p>For more information on what I do, please refer to my Projects page.</p>
