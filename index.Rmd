Hello! I'm a postdoctoral researcher working on mathematical modelling of infectious diseases.
I'm currently based at Institut Pasteur ([EMEA unit](https://research.pasteur.fr/fr/team/epidemiology-and-modelling-of-bacterial-escape-to-antimicrobials/)) and at the Conservatoire National des Arts et MÃ©tiers ([MESuRS lab](https://mesurs.cnam.fr/)).
My focus is on antimicrobial resistance (AMR), particularly how this problem evolves, spreads, and can be prevented.
For this, I study AMR across scales, from the invisible dynamics of gene transfer in bacterial populations, up the spread of pathogens across complex human contact networks.

For more information on what I do, please refer to my [Projects](./projects.html) page.
